## Lessons

### Acquiring Wisdom

- Publius Terentius wrote: "Nothing has yet been said that's not been said before."
- When understanding is separated from reality, we lose our power
- The only way you will know to which extent did you understand the subject is to put the work into reality
- Blind spots, where we can't see what we aren't looking for and don't notice what we don't notice
- Not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego induced denial and distance from consequences of our decisions
- Flaw is EGO: most of us are too much invested in our own point of view that we lack to see what world is offering us
- We become invested in defending instead of upgrading our ideas.
- You pay the price for your mistakes. Since you are a pain avoiding creature, you update your views.
- The further we are from the feedback of the decisions, the easier it is to convince ourselves we are right.
- Admitting we are wrong is tough. It is easier to fool ourselves that we are right at a high level than at the micro level, because at the micro level we see and feel the immediate consequences.
- As confucius said, "A man who has committed a mistake and does not correct it, is committing another mistake."
- We also tend to undervalue the elementary ideas and overvalue the complicated ones.
- Most geniuses -- especially those who lead otheres -- prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.
- Now you can see how we make suboptimal decisions and repeat mistakes. We are afraid to learn and admit when we don't know enough.
- There is an old adage that encapsulates this: "To the man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail."
- Learning basics of the other disciplines
- Parochialism
- When you start to understand the world, when the whys seem less mysterious, you gain confidence in how you navigate through it.

### General Thinking Concepts

- The Map is not the territory
- Territories change sometimes faster than the maps and models that describe them
- We cannot explore every bit of territory for ourselves. We can use maps to guide us, but we must not let them prevent us from discovering new territories.

### Circle of Competence

- When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, when we have blinc spots.
- In Alexander Pope's poem "An Essay on Criticism," he writes:
  "A little learning is a dangerous thing;
  Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring:
  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
  And drinking largely sobers us again."
- Keeping a journal of your own performance is the easiest and most private way to give self feedback
